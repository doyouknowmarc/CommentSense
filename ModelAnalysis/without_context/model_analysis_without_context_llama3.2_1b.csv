"Hey Jason, love you and your videos. My name is XXX and I'm in the US army and currently deployed in Iraq (me in pfp). Your videos have gotten me through a lot of tough days of deployment so first off thank you for entertaining me. But I have a request, I'm scheduled to come home on June 18th so if you could do a trick, any trick you like with the 6, 1, and 8 it would make my whole week. I wish you nothing but more success and growth on your channel and please keep posting so I don't die of boredom out here. I plan on going to a show when I get back this summer so post those dates as soon as you know them! All love from Iraq!""",NEGATIVE,"This sentiment is negative for several reasons. Firstly, the commenter expresses frustration and disappointment with Jason's content, stating that it has 'gotten me through a lot of tough days' but also implies that he feels neglected or unappreciated.

Additionally, the commenter's request for specific tricks in Jason's videos implies that they are looking for something new and exciting, rather than just entertaining themselves. The tone of the comment is also somewhat sarcastic, with phrases like 'I'm scheduled to come home on June 18th' which can be seen as a joke or a way of expressing relief at being able to leave the deployment situation behind. Overall, this sentiment is negative because it expresses frustration and disappointment with Jason's content and suggests that he needs to do more to engage with his audience.",2.42,0.02,324,0.10,218,2.30,0,1,8192

Another great vid. His CGI crew must be up to half a dozen employees by now to be able to keep up with all his amazing tricks  Genius is expensive,NEGATIVE,"This comment's sentiment can be classified as NEGATIVE due to the following reasons:
- The commenter uses the phrase 'Another great vid', which implies a lack of enthusiasm or excitement about the video.

- The use of all caps and excessive punctuation (e.g., multiple exclamation marks, emojis) creates a tone that is loud, aggressive, and attention-seeking.
