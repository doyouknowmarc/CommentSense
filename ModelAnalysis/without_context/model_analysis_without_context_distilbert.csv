"Hey Jason, love you and your videos. My name is XXX and I'm in the US army and currently deployed in Iraq (me in pfp). Your videos have gotten me through a lot of tough days of deployment so first off thank you for entertaining me. But I have a request, I'm scheduled to come home on June 18th so if you could do a trick, any trick you like with the 6, 1, and 8 it would make my whole week. I wish you nothing but more success and growth on your channel and please keep posting so I don't die of boredom out here. I plan on going to a show when I get back this summer so post those dates as soon as you know them! All love from Iraq!""",POSITIVE,"Confidence scores - Negative: 0.003, Positive: 0.997"
