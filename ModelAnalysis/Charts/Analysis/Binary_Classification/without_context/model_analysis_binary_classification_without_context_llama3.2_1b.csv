"Hey Jason, love you and your videos. My name is XXX and I'm in the US army and currently deployed in Iraq (me in pfp). Your videos have gotten me through a lot of tough days of deployment so first off thank you for entertaining me. But I have a request, I'm scheduled to come home on June 18th so if you could do a trick, any trick you like with the 6, 1, and 8 it would make my whole week. I wish you nothing but more success and growth on your channel and please keep posting so I don't die of boredom out here. I plan on going to a show when I get back this summer so post those dates as soon as you know them! All love from Iraq!""",NEGATIVE,"This sentiment is negative for several reasons. Firstly, the commenter expresses their gratitude towards Jason for entertaining them during tough times of deployment, but then immediately follows up with a request to perform a trick on his channel. This suggests that the commenter's primary motivation is not to engage with Jason's content, but rather to seek entertainment and distraction from their own experiences in Iraq. The use of phrases such as 'I wish you nothing but more success' also implies that the commenter feels overshadowed by Jason's achievements and does not feel valued or appreciated for his contributions to the channel. Furthermore, the commenter explicitly states that they plan on going to a show when they get back, implying that their time is limited and they are looking forward to leaving Iraq as soon as possible.
