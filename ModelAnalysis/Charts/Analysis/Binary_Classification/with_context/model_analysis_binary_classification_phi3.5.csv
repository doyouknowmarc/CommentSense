Leaving.  Very impressive but getting old.  Peace out.,NEGATIVE,"The sentiment of the comment is negative based on several factors in its tone, word choice, and implied context:   The phrase 'Leaving' indicates a departure from whatever situation or event was being discussed. This often carries a finality that can be associated with dissatisfaction or disinterest. Additionally, describing something as 'Very impressive' might initially suggest positivity; however, it is immediately followed by the negative connotation of getting old which implies frustration related to age and possibly an inability to keep up with expectations—this could refer either personally (to oneself) or professionally if discussing a service. The final statement 'Peace out' reinforces this negativity, as it is commonly used when someone decides they are done engaging due to discomfort and wishes for an end rather than continuation of the interaction. There isn’t any explicit positive sentiment expressed that would counterbalance these negative cues; hence, despite a potentially neutral or mixed beginning with praise, the overall tone leans towards dissatisfaction leading to withdrawal from participation.",7.97,0.01,672,2.86,250,5.10,0,1,8192
