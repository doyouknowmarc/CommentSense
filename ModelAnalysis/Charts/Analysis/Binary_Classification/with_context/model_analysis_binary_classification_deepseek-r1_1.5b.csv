Leaving.  Very impressive but getting old.  Peace out.,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it uses words like 'Leaving' and 'getting old,' which are not appropriate for a positive sentiment, and the language is overly casual and dismissive of others.",1.87,0.02,592,0.90,72,0.95,0,1,8192
"Hey Jason, love you and your videos. My name is XXX and I'm in the US army and currently deployed in Iraq (me in pfp). Your videos have gotten me through a lot of tough days of deployment so first off thank you for entertaining me. But I have a request, I'm scheduled to come home on June 18th so if you could do a trick, any trick you like with the 6, 1, and 8 it would make my whole week. I wish you nothing but more success and growth on your channel and please keep posting so I don't die of boredom out here. I plan on going to a show when I get back this summer so post those dates as soon as you know them! All love from Iraq!""",NEGATIVE,"The YouTube comment is negative because it expresses frustration and disappointment with the speaker's military background, which may not align with the content's positive intent. The request for a trick on numbers 6,1,8 seems irrelevant to the video's humor or entertainment value. Additionally, the mention of going back to Iraq and planning a show suggests a desire for a more serious or personal project, which contradicts the intended positive tone of the comment.",1.70,0.01,735,0.13,121,1.56,0,1,8192
He even trash talks himself  truly no one is safe,NEGATIVE,"The comment uses strong, negative language like 'trash talks' and 'no one is safe.' These words are highly charged with negativity. The context of the video is about a top cosmetic dentist in San Diego offering a $500 discount to viewers, which seems positive. However, the negative sentiment towards the speaker's behavior contradicts the positive intent behind the offer, creating a conflict that leans towards negativity.",1.53,0.01,590,0.04,115,1.47,0,1,8192
"Welcome to the hustle, indeed! üòÖ I love how the ""includes paid promotion"" tag was there. I don't even know what's real anymore. But you are still the goal.",NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it dismisses the reality of the offer and focuses on the humor without providing any information about the actual content or quality of the product or service. The use of phrases like 'I don't even know what's real anymore' and 'you are still the goal' creates a humorous but misleading tone, which can be seen as negative because it undermines the credibility and intent behind the offer.",1.37,0.01,617,0.06,103,1.29,0,1,8192
"""I am so good""  ü§£ü§£ü§£",NEGATIVE,The comment is negative because it uses a sarcastic tone and lacks context.

It doesn't matter how many times I watch these videos  or how many times I think I might've seen something... This guy right here is hands down the best I've ever seen. It's not even close. And he seems like he'd be a helluva guy to hang out with! Thanks for all the awesome content!,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it dismisses the video's quality and praise the speaker without giving any indication of the actual sentiment. The use of phrases like 'hands down' and 'helluva guy' suggests a lack of genuine support for the content, which contradicts the positive intent behind the video.",1.17,0.01,646,0.08,83,1.08,0,1,8192
Nicely done and she paid 500 for an advertisement.  üòÇ,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it's dismissive of the speaker's expertise, uses a sarcastic tone, and doesn't provide context about the speaker's credentials or the quality of their work. The phrase 'nicely done' suggests that the speaker is not impressed by the video's quality, which contradicts the positive intent behind the comment.",1.36,0.01,596,0.04,101,1.30,0,1,8192
Saw Jason live in Boca Raton. He is even better live.

Always love the waterfall trick! Truly impressive,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it uses a strong, unflattering comparison of 500 bucks to San Diego's top cosmetic dentist. The word 'top' and the phrase 'only one place to go' make the sentiment seem dismissive or unprofessional. Additionally, the use of 'seems like I'm advertising pull a queen and an ace together from the waterfall' is overly dramatic and conveys frustration rather than positivity.",1.31,0.01,587,0.04,103,1.26,0,1,8192
I have been watching you very closely do these tricks and I can never spot how in the world you pull these tricks off. So after careful analysis  I have decided that Magic is 100% real and you my friend have mastered it!,NEGATIVE,"The comment starts with a strong statement about being closely watching and never spotting the trick, which suggests frustration or disappointment. The use of words like 'Magic' and 'real' can be seen as critical acclaim, implying that the speaker believes Magic is genuine. However, the mention of 'I have been watching you very closely do these tricks and I can never spot how in the world you pull these tricks off' creates a sense of frustration or confusion about the authenticity of Magic. The conclusion with 'I have decided that Magic is 100% real and you my friend have mastered it!' implies a belief in the truth, which may not align with the negative sentiment towards Magic as a product.",1.99,0.01,628,0.06,156,1.91,0,1,8192
This man's CGI machine must be burning  üòÇ,NEGATIVE,"The comment uses a playful and exaggerated tone, which can sometimes lead to negative sentiment. The phrase 'CGI machine must be burning' is meant to mock the overused or unrealistic use of CGI in the video, but it's unclear if this is intended as a critique or just a humorous statement. Additionally, the context doesn't provide enough information about the video's content or the speaker's intent, making it difficult to assess the sentiment accurately.",1.60,0.01,590,0.04,122,1.54,0,1,8192
Another great vid. His CGI crew must be up to half a dozen employees by now to be able to keep up with all his amazing tricks  Genius is expensive,NEGATIVE,"The comment uses negative language like ' genius' and ' expensive', which can imply dissatisfaction or criticism. The word ' CGI crew' might suggest a positive aspect, but the overall tone leans towards negativity due to the negative descriptors.",1.07,0.01,611,0.06,78,1.00,0,1,8192
Hardest thing for Mr Jason - talking to the wall like there is actually someone standing,NEGATIVE,"The comment uses negative language about Mr. Jason's difficulty in speaking, which may imply a lack of confidence or self-confidence. The phrase 'talking to the wall' suggests confusion and perhaps an inability to express himself clearly, which could be seen as negative towards someone who might not have the same level of confidence.",1.30,0.01,596,0.04,96,1.24,0,1,8192
Respect for leaving in the blooper,NEGATIVE,"The comment uses negative language like 'respect for leaving in the blooper' which implies a lack of respect and a critical view. The word 'bTranslator' is used, which might be a typo or slang for something else, possibly indicating a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the speaker's intent. Additionally, the mention of San Diego and a top cosmetic dentist without any positive reinforcement suggests a negative sentiment towards the service.",1.56,0.01,587,0.04,117,1.50,0,1,8192
Leap out of the deck??!! üòÇ cgi machines ready üòÇüòÇüòÇ Jason you leave me stunned my friend!!! you are so MASTER GOAT!!! ‚ù§‚ù§ Greetz Spiecull. üéâ,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it uses strong language like 'Leap out of the deck' and 'Grimace machines ready', which sounds aggressive and disrespectful. The mention of Jason leaving the speaker stunned and his friend being a master goat is also hurtful and offensive. The use of phrases like 'gripz' and 'greets spiecull' adds to the negativity, making it feel like the speaker is being attacked or made fun of. Additionally, the context from the transcript shows that the speaker is in San Diego and has a high demand for a top cosmetic dentist, which might not align with their actual intent, further contributing to the negative sentiment.",2.17,0.01,622,0.06,166,2.10,0,1,8192
I love when someone who is the best at something is arrogant.  You've certainly earned the right.,NEGATIVE,"The comment uses negative language and dismisses others' abilities, which can be seen as critical and harsh. The word 'arrogant' conveys arrogance, which may not align with a positive sentiment towards a dentist. Additionally, the context of the video is about being in San Diego for a top cosmetic dentist, implying respect and expertise, but the comment's tone doesn't reflect that.",1.49,0.01,599,0.04,111,1.43,0,1,8192
Waterfall with two cards. Absolutely incredible!,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it uses a strong, unflattering comparison of the waterfall and the cards, which makes it seem like the dentist service is poor or not worth the money. The use of 'waterfall' implies difficulty in moving cards out of the deck, which isn't relevant to the actual service quality. Additionally, the mention of 'King of Hearts' and 'Shuff' suggests a playful and possibly over-the-top approach, but this doesn't address the negative sentiment about the service.",1.77,0.01,587,0.04,134,1.71,0,1,8192
I really enjoy this channel. Your card manipulation skills are mind blowing. Take care eh ‚úåÔ∏èüá®üá¶,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it uses strong language like 'mind blowing' and 'take care eh ‚úåÔ∏èüá®üá¶', which can be seen as critical or dismissive towards the content of the video. The use of exclamation marks and casual language might also make the sentiment seem more negative than it actually is.",1.31,0.01,601,0.04,96,1.25,0,1,8192
Aha!mm     i figuree it out ...If you look at the dark silver car thats just behind Jasons head  on the book shelf  payclose  attention to the angle of the green case .. then after he touches his face  roughly around 42 seconds in  you will notice that i have no idea how he does it,NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it's overly dramatic and uses strong language without providing any constructive information. The mention of Jasons head, green case angle, and the timing of the action make it seem like a performance or trick, which is not appropriate for a comment about a real person's work. Additionally, the lack of specific details about how the dentist performs adds to the negative tone.",1.52,0.01,649,0.08,110,1.43,0,1,8192
"""Shuffles legit obviously.""",NEGATIVE,"The comment is negative because it uses hyperbole and lacks context. The phrase 'Shuffles legit obviously' is overly dramatic and does not convey any positive sentiment about the speaker's expertise or the content of the video. Additionally, the use of phrases like 'top cosmetic dentist' without providing specific details about the speaker's credentials makes the comment feel dismissive.",1.11,0.01,584,0.04,86,1.06,0,1,8192
