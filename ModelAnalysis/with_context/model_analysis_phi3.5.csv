Leaving.  Very impressive but getting old.  Peace out.,NEUTRAL,"The sentiment of the comment is neutral with a slight lean towards positive undertones. Here's the detailed analysis:   Tone Analysis - The tone starts off as appreciative, indicated by 'Very impressive,' which suggests that the speaker acknowledges something noteworthy or skillful about what they witnessed on YouTube (possibly related to card tricks). However, it transitions into a more reflective and slightly negative sentiment with 'getting old' and concludes with 'Peace out.' The phrase 'Leaving,' combined with these mixed emotions, suggests that the speaker is moving away from their current situation. Key Phrases - While phrases like 'Very impressive' convey admiration or positive feelings towards what they have seen, terms such as 'getting old' and a final farewell ('Peace out') introduce an element of resignation about aging which can be perceived negatively in some contexts. Context Consideration - Without additional video content to directly relate the comment to specific events within it (as no transcript was provided), we infer that this is likely a standalone reaction or personal reflection rather than a direct response to an ongoing discussion from the YouTube video itself. The overall sentiment does not strongly lean towards positive, negative, nor remains neutral; instead, these contrasting elements balance each other out. Conclusion - Given the appreciation mixed with acceptance of aging and departure in tone, this comment can be classified as having a predominantly neutral sentiment but with subtle positivity due to recognition of skill or impressiveness before concluding on leaving. Therefore, considering both positive aspects (impressive) and negative undertones (aging), the overall classification leans towards NEUTRAL rather than strongly POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.",10.76,0.01,683,2.56,393,8.20,0,1,8192
